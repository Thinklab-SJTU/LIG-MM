All codes are from https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/benchmarking/sv-benchmarks/-/tree/main/c. 

We took a part of the programs and modified them into a uniform format. 
The source code is placed in `original_codes` folder, and each subfolder has the same name as the original folder name of SV-COMP. The modified program is placed in the corresponding folder of the `changed_codes` folder.
