The course code is mainly derived from homework programs on the data structure and programming language courses. 

The detailed course number and college name are covered due to the anonymity of this paper. 

We group the programs by the data structures they mainly use.

These programs contain the most diverse data structures and multi-level pointer operations among the sources of our benchmark.
